NAME
       icmpush - ICMP packet builder

SYNOPSIS
       icmpush type [options] host

DESCRIPTION
       icmpush is a tool that builds ICMP packets fully customized from command line.

       It supports the following ICMP error types: Redirect, Source Quench, Time Exceeded, Destination Unreach and Parameter Problem.

       And the following ICMP information types: Address Mask Request, Timestamp, Information Request, Echo Request, Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement.

       Is not of our concern to give a fully description of how ICMP protocol works, but the more knowledgement we have we can fully understand its management, use and posibilities of this tool.

       The  quantity  of  arguments  needed can appear excessive but his own author reminds that some imperative data must be given through a command line for a fully adjustment to the protocol format on a
       ICMP packet construction.

       A long number of examples is given at the EXAMPLES section of this page that shows a real use of this program.

OPTIONS

              Next ICMP CODES section enumerates the valid code types.

ICMP CODES
       Valid codes used with Destination Unreach, Redirect y Time Exceeded types are,

       - Used with Destination Unreach type (-du):

       net-unreach (Net Unreachable) The destination net is unreacheable.

       host-unreach (Host Unreachable) The destination host is unreacheable.

       prot-unreach (Protocol Unreachable) desired protocol is unreacheable to destination host.

       port-unreach (Port Unreachable) desired port is unreacheable to destination host.

       frag-needed (Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set) Shows that IP packet had to be fragmented because of its size but the sender did not allowed it because of DF (DON'T FRAGMENT) flag.

       sroute-fail (Source Route Failed) could'nt follow the route indicated on IP packet.

       net-unknown (Destination Network Unknown) Destination network is unknown.

       host-unknown (Destination Host Unknown) Destination host unknown but network is.

       host-isolated (Source Host Isolated) Can't reach destination host.

       net-ano (Communication with Destination Network is Administratively Prohibited) access network is denied through firewall or similar on receiver side.

       host-ano (Communication with Destination Host is Administratively Prohibited) access host is denied through firewall or similar on receiver side.

       net-unr-tos (Destination Network Unreachable for Type of Service) indicates on destination network that the Type Of Service (TOS) applied for is not allowed.

       host-unr-tos (Destination Host Unreachable for Type of Service) shows that destination host is unreachable with applied TOS.

       com-admin-prohib (Communication Administratively Prohibited) a router can't forward a packet because of administrative filter.

       host-precedence-viol (Host Precedence Violation) IP packet procedence is not allowed.

       precedence-cutoff (Precedence cutoff in effect) a smaller IP packet precedence has tried to be sent over the minimous impossed by network's manager.

       - To be used with Redirect type (-red):

       net (Redirect Datagram for the Network) shows that destination is a network.

       host (Redirect Datagram for the Host) shows that destination is a host.

       serv-net (Redirect Datagram for the Type Of Service and Network) destination is a type of service and network.

       serv-host (Redirect Datagram for the Type Of Service and Host) destination is a type of service and host.

       and

       - to be used with Time Exceeded type (-tx):

       ttl (Time to Live exceeded in Transit) time is over on an IP's header packet.

       frag (Fragment Reassembly Time Exceeded) could not put IP's packet fragment together again.

EXAMPLES
       -  In  response to a packet send with TCP source port 100 and destination on port 90, we want to send and ICMP Redirect to asshole.es to modify its routing table with the following data: 10.12.12.12
       as a gateway to the host death.es masking the packet source as if it was sent from infect.comx host:

       - We want to send an ICMP Router Advertisement to host death.es, saying that the routers to use are: router1.xtc with preference 20, router2.xtc with preference 50 and router3.xtc with default pref‚Äê
       erence (0). We mask ourselves as fatherouter.xtc

       icmpush -rta router1.xtc/20 -rta router2.xtc/50 -rta router3.xtc -sp fatherouter.xtc death.es

       - We send an ICMP Parameter Problem to host misery.es saying that the packet sent from the host hick.org with udp protocol, source port 13 and destination port 53, has an error on the IP header byte
